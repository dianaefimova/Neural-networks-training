# Neural-networks-training

The purpose of the project is to analyse and predict data using neural network.
In order to archive project goals,  raisin data was chosen in csv format. The data shows the characteristics of raisin along with its class.

 The final goal of the work is to train multiclass ANN in a way that it can predict the class of raisin with highest possible accuracy. 
Along the way were performed confusion Matrix with metrics and in addition, accuracy score was calculated.
 So at to perform the project the knowledge gotten from the AI and Machine Learning course were applied, specifically ANN Regression & Multiclass Classification and ANN Classification classes were used as a reference for the project, as well as own research in the Internet.

Algorithms used: 
    • scaling data
    • creating and teaching a neural network
    • testing the neural network with the data
    • confusion matrix and metrics
    • accuracy score
    • prediction with test data

In order to run the code locally, the following steps are recommended: 

1. git clone https://github.com/dianaefimova/Neural-networks-training.git 

2. Open the Python code with the suited IDE (recommended: Spyder in the Anaconda environment)
